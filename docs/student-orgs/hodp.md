# Harvard Open Data Project

The [Harvard Undergraduate Open Project](https://hodp.org), or HODP, is a student-faculty group that aims to increase transparency and solve problems on campus using public Harvard data.

Our flagship product is Harvard’s first open data catalog, where we’ve gathered dozens of public Harvard datasets in a free repository. We’ve used data science and data visualization techniques to analyze data on campus safety, faculty gender disparity, student government election turnout, and trends in concentration popularity, to name a few.

HODP’s community includes over 100 undergraduates as well as several Harvard faculty: Nick Sinai, the former deputy CTO of the US and current HKS professor; Jim Waldo, the former Harvard CTO; and others.
