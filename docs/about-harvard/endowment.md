# Harvard Endowment

The Harvard endowment provides a permanent and reliable source of funding for Harvard University. Income generated from the endowment supports various aspects of university operations, including financial aid, faculty salaries, research programs, campus facilities, and more. Harvard's endowment in particular is one of the largest in the world, valued at around $50 billion in 2022.

The Harvard Office of Institutional Research & Analytics has compiled a summary of [endowment statistics](https://oira.harvard.edu/factbook/fact-book-endowment/) dating back to 2012, including fields such as the endowment value, annual return on investment (ROI), and more.
