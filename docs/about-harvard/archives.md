# Harvard Archives

The [Harvard University Archives](https://library.harvard.edu/libraries/harvard-university-archives) are a vast collection of historical documents, records, manuscripts, photographs, and other materials related to Harvard University's academic and institutional history. Through these archives, students, scholars, and researchers gain access to primary source materials that document the university's evolution over time.

With resources both online and at the Pusey Library in Harvard Yard, some of the key features in the Harvard Archives include institutional records dating back to 1636, papers written by student and faculty, and various multimedia materials (photos, film, and more). For example, Harvard has kept [records](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/4/resources/4017) of a Harvard College Observatory station in Peru and the [papers of Henry Dunster](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/4/resources/4252), Harvard's first president.
