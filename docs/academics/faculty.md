# Faculty and Staff

The [Faculty and Staff](https://oira.harvard.edu/factbook/fact-book-faculty-staff/) data is part of the Harvard Common Dataset collected and organized by the Office of Institutional Research & Analytics. This section has information regarding faculty and staff demographics among full-time (and equivalent) positions obtained through the HR PeopleSoft system. It includes headcounts on the number of staff across the different Harvard schools, as well as records on the demographic distributions and their locations.
