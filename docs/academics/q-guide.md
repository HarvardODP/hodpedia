# The Q Guide

The Q Guide will be your saving grace throughout your time at Harvard. At the end of each academic semester, students are invited to complete course evaluations for each of their classes, and these anonymized responses are compiled into reports, made available to students to use as references for future semesters. 

Currently, the catalog of Q Guides, which can be accessed [here](https://qreports.fas.harvard.edu/browse/index) with HarvardKey login, contains reports back to Fall 2019. Each report contains mean scores (out of 5) for the overall class, instructors, and various other metrics to measure the effectiveness of the class. There are also metrics on the average amount of hours a student spends on the class per week, how many students would recommend the class and at what level of enthusiasm, and subjective comments made anonymously by current students to future students.

Check out the following HODP articles that conduct interesting data analysis using the Q Guides!
