# Course Enrollment

The [Course Enrollment Archives](https://registrar.fas.harvard.edu/links/archive/enrollment-reports) contains Harvard's historical course enrollment data by term, beginning from Fall of 1998 to the present day. Each semester is linked to a unique dataset which contains the courses offered that semester, their department, instructor, and enrollment statistics, such as the types of enrollees.

Check out some HODP articles that analyze datasets from the Fact Book!
