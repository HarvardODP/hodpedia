# Harvard Houses

The house system is one of the most unique and beloved aspects of campus culture at Harvard. Every spring, students dress up with house spirit on Housing Day, on which first-year students find out from the housing lottery which house they will live in for the rest of their time at Harvard.

House life at Harvard offers many opportunities for data analysis: the randomness (or not?) behind the housing lottery, the performance of the popular Housing Day videos, and the popularity of the 12 houses!
