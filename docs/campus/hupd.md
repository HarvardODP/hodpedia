# HUPD

Harvard University Police Department (HUPD) releases a public daily crime log that records data on incidents that occur on campus. The log includes information on the nature of the crime, date and time, location, and disposition. Incidents are published on the report within two days of their occurrence, and any subsequent changes are updated on the log. The two official logs are physical copies located at the HUPD headquarters (1033 Massachusetts Ave) and the HUPD Longwood office (90 Smith St, Roxbury). The online copy is not official, but HUPD attempts to keep it as updated as possible. Find a more detailed breakdown of costs [here](https://www.hupd.harvard.edu/public-police-log).
