# HUDS

HUDS (Harvard University Dining Services) provides data on their [website](https://dining.harvard.edu/campus-dining/undergraduate-dining/weeks-menu) about daily meals and their nutritional value. Additionally, HODP members have analyzed dining trends on campus using swipe data from the dining halls and the HUDS text feedback system!
