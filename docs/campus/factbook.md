# Harvard Common Dataset (OIRA Fact Book)

The [Harvard Common Dataset](https://oira.harvard.edu/factbook/), also known as the Fact Book, is a collection of statistics compiled by the Office of Institutional Research & Analytics on topics ranging from admissions and enrollment to annual financial reports and organizational structure of the institution.

Many of the datasets on the other pages can be accessed through the Fact Book, such as the dataset on [undergraduate tuition and fees](https://oira.harvard.edu/factbook/fact-book-ug-tuition/), the [annual financial report](https://finance.harvard.edu/annual-report), and statistics on the [Harvard endowment](https://oira.harvard.edu/factbook/fact-book-endowment/).
